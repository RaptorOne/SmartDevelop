Issue: #Include

Each Project is splitted up in some files. As files can be #included everywhere in another file, the tokenizer/parser design must handle this.
Each file can be Tokenized separatly. Tokenizing doesn't analyze the sense of the code, so the tokenizer results can be cached.

The resulting CodeSegments from the Tokenizer must contain File, Line and Column information.
Those Codesegments then gets parsed and analyzed everytime something changes in one of the included files.


There might be opertunities to minimize the re-parsing when Includefiles not violate Blocks and are Included at the beginning.
